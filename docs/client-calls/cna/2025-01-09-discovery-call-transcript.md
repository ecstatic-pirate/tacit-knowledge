So

**Raul Bergen - 0:07**
Good morning. Happy new year Nick. Hi, new there, year. Good. Nick morning. Good to see you. Happy

**Nick Allen - 0:12**
See you too.

**Raul Bergen - 0:16**
I saw on the invitation, we're gonna be a big party today.

**Raul Bergen - 0:22**
We have 3 I think 3 people were invited from the CNA side. Yeah.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:28**
Happy holidays.

**Nick Allen - 0:30**
Yeah. Happy holidays. Happy new year.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:34**
So it was good to get her Thomas my first time seeing you this new year. So I guess I could say happy new year to you too.

**Thomas Bergen - 0:41**
Hello. Denis happy new year morning.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:45**
Good morning.

**Raul Bergen - 0:46**
Good morning, everybody.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:49**
Good morning, pat. Mary, pat, sorry.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:54**
I get something blocking my screen.

**Denis Sternberg - 0:58**
I help you to mind we're gonna record this for future posterity just for to make sure that we capture everything that we need to capture.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:10**
And have a good understanding.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:13**
Of how we can help CNA? Are we waiting for anybody else?

**Nick Allen - 1:20**
No, I don't think. I actually I think there's one more crystal. I think I was gonna join us too.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:26**
Okay. Great. We can wait a few seconds nations.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:35**
Is crystal

**Raul Bergen - 1:36**
Good morning, crystal.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:38**
Good morning.

**Denis Sternberg - 1:41**
Hey, good.

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 1:42**
Morning, everyone?

**Denis Sternberg - 1:44**
Good morning. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I really appreciate that. You're taking time out of your day to to consider and to learn more about getAbstract and our new Verizon product and how we can help you. I'm gonna turn over the session to Raul who's gonna lead us through and ask some point pointed questions to you guys to see where where you're at right now and kind of show you what we're what we've been up to and our new product and how getAbstract may be able to help you.

**Nick Allen - 2:17**
Before you jump in since I'm the one that kind of brought everyone together. I'll do a quick introduction and then hand it over. And if there's any anything else to that you want to add from the CNA side and what we're hoping to get out of this conversation as well. But just to give you all some just a really quick intro on and some context on this. So Mary pat and I were at a conference several weeks ago for the executive learning exchange. And I had met Dennis and learn more about getAbstract and what really caught my attention and getAbstract and the technology that they have in the services they offer was how it might help in particular with individuals that are retiring and capturing knowledge from those individuals. But the way they are able to catalog information and the way they use AI to continue to draw out information out of the the individual that might be leaving just for not obviously every person that's retiring in operations, but there's some really critical individuals that that hold on to some knowledge that I could that I thought it could be helpful, but I was briefing Vanessa and Mary pad on this. We're checking in like a couple of weeks later. And and Vanessa I had thought this might also be something to explore is an option as we're thinking about business process and capturing some of the the knowledge that goes with the business process and the documentation that goes with it. That might help to accelerate what that process currently looks like. So those are a couple of things that came up. And so just just by quick way of introduction, we have Vanessa and crystal and Mary pat that are all leaders in the operations group specifically our operational excellence team. And and then of course, we have a couple of folks here from the getAbstract team. I don't know if there's anything else Vanessa or Mary path or crystal you want to to chime in on what you might be open to get from the conversation before we hand it over to the getAbstract team.

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 4:41**
Finally, the process design side of the house. So yeah. We definitely have to go in and understand current state. Look at what the opportunities are for redesign depending on what the strategic objectives are of each initiative. So that's of most interest to me. And of course we have just like if any people leader role, right? We have situations where we have to get knowledge from folks that are retiring or looking at what their next step is. So that's of course, as a leader also of interest to me. So both sides of that coin, for sure.

**Mary Pat Zolna - 5:17**
And hi, I'm Mary pat zone and I lead within organizational process is I lead training communication and change management. And I'm coming that this from the angle of that process. Documentation is really critical for us as we design training. So we're designing to a consistent standard. And also how whatever tools you have available might help us capture that information from our subject matter experts as we work with them to design and develop training and do that more efficiently. How AI can help accelerate that process as well?

**Denis Sternberg - 5:49**
I love it. Great. Perfect.

**Denis Sternberg - 5:52**
Perfect. You want to introduce yourself and Thomas I'll let you introduce your yourself as well. And myself. I'm been with getAbstract for almost 19 years. And I'm here to help you bring value to any partnership that could abstract has with CNA.

**Raul Bergen - 6:14**
Then is that's incredible by the way, 19 years. It's

**Denis Sternberg - 6:20**
18 have to be

**Raul Bergen - 6:22**
Perfect. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you all. I know, Nick we already met on our last 2 talks, I believe we had already. My name is Raul and I am right now heading this newest project in task at knowledge capture. And I'd love to understand your perspective on on how you think something that could work and I'd love to show you where we are currently at.

**Raul Bergen - 6:45**
Thomas, you're on mute, I think very classical.

**Thomas Bergen - 6:49**
Mute. Yeah, that's it classic. And sorry, my name is Thomas. I started it as 27. Yes. So and always when we are doing stuff like that new projects, new customers in new directions, I'm very interested to feel

**Thomas Bergen - 7:06**
Very close. What's what's going on?

**Raul Bergen - 7:11**
Perfect. Let me maybe start by summarizing a bit. What we had understood from from the last talks we had with Nick and the email exchange we had there. The kind of the framing that we got and please correct me there. Anyone from from CNA if there's something that I misunderstood. You the problem statement that we were given is you have 10 critical people leaving, right? These are people with critical knowledge. These can be people in the for example, people in in technologies in the technology sector, people in the audit space sector. Many of them had over 30 years of experience, right? There's some kind of this is not a simple task. It's not just oh, this is anybody at the company that's leaving. These are actually people with lots of experience and process knowledge and kind of one of the challenges. And this is where I'd love to understand your current take one of the challenges, is to really capture this knowledge structure, it process it, tag and index it. That it is best readily available for anyone still at the company in CNA and in another way, also readily available inside of any of the AI systems that you're currently using. And with that, I know, Nick, you gave us a little bit of an intro with an email.

**Raul Bergen - 8:34**
You were telling us that you are already leading some initiatives to capture this tacit knowledge through interviews and I maybe wanted to understand a bit from your end how does this currently look like? What are you guys doing what works with that? What doesn't work? And that maybe helps us frame a bit, what we've been working on and then I'll show you guys a bit to what we thought and what we have built up to show you. Is that all right?

**Nick Allen - 9:05**
Yeah. And just to make sure to clarify and make sure we're on the same page, it's actually I'd say 2 separate buckets. There's like the entire knowledge. There's one that we started the conversation with. And then I think the last email that I had sent was more in relation to a different bucket, which is more about business process redesign work that's being done and capturing some of the the knowledge that happens through interviews and such as part of that process.

**Raul Bergen - 9:31**
Okay. The business process and everything, that's rather on the whole operations group level, right? That's so you just want to capture these business processes and feed them into an AI so that they're ready readily available in there and it's not just lost knowledge, is that correct then?

**Raul Bergen - 9:48**
Yeah.

**Mary Pat Zolna - 9:48**
I think so.

**Mary Pat Zolna - 9:50**
Well and capture it efficiently, right? Of course, accurately and efficiently, right? Today we do a lot of working sessions and we record and take that recording and transcribe and create process maps, journey maps, procedure, documentation, how do we do that all more efficiently and effectively? The second part of that is how do we draw knowledge out of people's head when they've got 30 years of experience. And they tell us they're retiring in a month or something and we have very little time to

**Mary Pat Zolna - 10:21**
Capture that

**Raul Bergen - 10:22**
Maybe Mary pat if you can give us a little bit more of insight into the process, you're currently doing to capture this these business processes, right? What how does it look like? I mean, I understood you record the sessions, but do you have any frameworks? Do you have any tool to use what works? What's for example, a pain that you currently have which which you would need addressed? Maybe you can give me a bit of insight on those processes.

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 10:49**
Yeah. I could chime in here. So we typically will sit with me and do a demo of the process. The one of the challenges I would say is that if you ask 2 different needs, you might get 2 different answers. Yeah. If the process isn't documented, right, I'm assuming here, undocumented, it's just in someone's head. So we have a challenge with we might get several different variations of the process. And then we have to understand what's the best path, right? Like what's most efficient most effective and that usually takes some some time and some interviews and discovery. So but we typically start with a demo and then we have that process documented. And then we'll do like some validation exercises after that to understand if this is where we want to go. Or if it's something that we need a lot more redesign around.

**Raul Bergen - 11:40**
And which ones of these processes are human driven? Purely human driven?

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 11:45**
My team is the only business process the human manual process. So we'll sometimes work with technology to understand what the technology functionality is and then what the human touches. But my team is fully the manual business process. They're not that. We don't work on the automated piece of that.

**Raul Bergen - 12:02**
And maybe maybe I didn't ask my question, right? But you're working on the manual process of these business processes, but now do you use any any tools or anything in terms of AI tools for the capture or for the process of this information? How does that look like?

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 12:19**
Yeah. We have an AI tool that we've rolled out across enterprise that we've been using. But it's more of capturing notes and kind of take aways and things like that of like big decision points that we can leverage and then we just do pretty much we record everything, right? Like record the session itself. That's not really AI. We have that tool, but that's pretty pretty limited right now and what it can give us. We also work with a vendor that will go through and do process mapping for us and identify opportunities for efficiency and technology opportunities to automate things like that will make our processes more efficient and less manual.

**Raul Bergen - 13:01**
Okay. I see. And just 2 more more questions. Sorry about that. The first one is the interviewers that you have. Is this you know, is this a very scalable group? Is this a lot of people that you're sending it? Is it one person? How does it currently look like? Is that a bottleneck you're currently experiencing or

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 13:21**
Yeah. We're small but might be team. So if we have it's a little bit more just in time when we're going into the project as far as needing to do some kind of process enhancement or redesign. If we could get ahead a little bit, we just don't have the manpower to get ahead of documenting current state. Process and we don't have current state. But I will say there's also a little bit of a relationship piece because we work with our under so we're organizational process. Excellent. So we cover underwriting and operations and there's a little bit of a relationship aspect in. Going into a underwriters desk and sitting there and kind of drilling into what they do day to day. There's a we have a small but mighty team, but also with that kind of reputation relationship piece, that kind of brings a little bit more to the table then just somebody random going in and saying kind of watch your process. We have we make sure like they don't you know, we don't have our vendors or anything interact just directly with our underwriting business partners. It's typically somebody from our team and then we'll go back to our vendor and or be on the call with the vendor. If you know, we're trying to document process and understand something current state. So it's that like, our group is also like a lead on from a maintaining that relationship aspect, which is the last

**Raul Bergen - 14:43**
Sentence, sorry.

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 14:44**
Sorry. Yeah. Our group also maintains that relationship aspect with our different we're in a business partner model in our organization. So with our different business partner groups, which are typically roles in the process, right? but we really like are the glue to kind of bring that together and make sure that there's a lot of trust and safety when we're thinking about change, because change should be scary when you go into

**Raul Bergen - 15:05**
One

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 15:05**
Right. For people for users or something is gonna change about their work. So that I would say is also an element that's really important to keep forefront. And like I said, our team is small, but mighty. But we don't have a lot of capacity to get very, very ahead of documenting current state processes when we have undocumented business units, basically.

**Raul Bergen - 15:29**
Love it. Thank you very much. Yeah, Thomas please. Go ahead.

**Thomas Bergen - 15:34**
Crystal. So

**Thomas Bergen - 15:39**
Is it. Did I understand correctly that you're trying to achieve the knowledge from insurance underwriters the processes, they need to evaluate the risks of

**Thomas Bergen - 15:56**
Somehow re ensuring risks.

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 16:04**
Yeah. Our team is processed. So the actual underwriting of a policy is more of that. It's not the process, right? It's more like analyzing risks and things like that. So we don't support that as much. We support more than repeatable standard processes around those. Yeah, like the actual it's a little bit of a like, a coverage and risk and then ours is like what's the business process? How does the workflow move through? we have different hand off where we have support or policy servicing. What does that all look like? End to end?

**Raul Bergen - 16:40**
Okay. Okay. And here like

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 16:43**
Okay. Yeah, I know you have a lot of questions. I know we're halfway through I'm really curious to hear a little bit more about your product as well. And

**Raul Bergen - 16:49**
Perfect. Look for. I'll then just cut to the chase and it gets straight down to what were working on. We got this request from from you guys or at least this idea. I think 2 months ago now was the first time we spoke Nick. And we started kind of tackling this problem. Now with the team we're working on because our expertise over the last 27 years, we've built up expertise in finding describing structuring and verifying knowledge. And now in the last 3 years also, we've taken up the expertise of transforming this knowledge in the format needed for AI systems, right? So all our expertise lies with knowledge or expertise lies with the structure and the verification so that it's best fit and the capture. So it's best fit for these AI systems. So when Nick kind of came with this request, it was perfect. Because this is a natural kind of direction were now flowing in. I want to just give you the

**Raul Bergen - 17:59**
The insights we have now for Thomas, how long is this maybe 15 years been inside of tacit knowledge capture?

**Raul Bergen - 18:06**
We have been in taken knowledge capture. Now, for 15 years, we have had clients where obviously, 15 years ago, task at knowledge. Capture was close to what you are guys are doing right now, right? It's humans speaking to other humans. Writing everything down, right? Our expertise 15 years ago was heavily focused on summarize ion. So the value we brought is we would have these hundreds of interviews and we would summarize them into reports. We could then hand out to the peers or to the high level managers. And obviously now with the AI tools that have been rolled out in the last 3 years, we have a massive massive massive advantage where we can take the structure and the experience and the knowledge we have right now built over the last 15 years in capturing this asset knowledge and mix it with the incredible scalability and dynamic framework that AI allows us. That AI gives us in preparing for these interviews in guiding these interviews in real time, right? So giving the interviewer suggest the questions tracking, how the skills are being filled out and planning for future interviews depending on the inputs we get from the people. So that's a bit what I'd like to show you. Our approach that we have built up is a hybrid approach.

**Raul Bergen - 19:27**
Especially Nick you told us last time that you would really value an approach that puts the human in the interviewer position. Because like you mentioned you have people that have been there for 30 plus years and you wouldn't want them just to kind of spit in all their information into an AI because that just it doesn't work and it's it doesn't it doesn't honor the person's life work if it's 30 plus years, right? It's quite some time at the company. So we have heavily focused on everything that we're building right now. And we're gonna show you is this hybrid approach where we want to empower it's a platform for the interviewer. That gives the interviewer all the tools necessary to plan to schedule to capture to report and evaluate and then to feed into AI systems, this whole knowledge and that's a bit what I'd like to show you guys right now.

**Raul Bergen - 20:26**
Before I start any questions with anything I said or so?

**Raul Bergen - 20:30**
So we're good then. Perfect. Thomas, you're still on mute thought I saw your lips. Yeah.

**Thomas Bergen - 20:35**
Just one input. When we started doing it, just that to have an idea we were running around with video cameras doing the interviews and filming it was our first customer more Swiss grid a customer.

**Thomas Bergen - 20:53**
The 30% of the employees were retiring within the next 5 years and they are in charge of the whole how we're grid in Switzerland. So it was highly relevant that this knowledge is being transferred how to maintain that power grid and um

**Thomas Bergen - 21:20**
But nowadays, obviously you can do that differently.

**Raul Bergen - 21:26**
Perfect. I'm gonna share my screen here, please. Just let me know if you can see it. I've had some trouble sharing my screen.

**Mary Pat Zolna - 21:33**
Today, you're good. We can see it. Okay.

**Raul Bergen - 21:36**
Perfect. Thank you very much. What I'd like to show you here. Again, the focus is this the platform for the human expert that is doing the interviews or for the sponsor of these interviews, the one that wants to plan them to to have an overview of the interviews to have an overview of the skills that have been captured, to be able to generate reports to share these reports very easily and most importantly to prepare these interviews and give that give the system that we're generating as much context as possible to execute then these interviews with the biggest success rate as possible. What I'm showing you guys here is our overview page, which which shows you all the sessions we have out to capture interviews, right? We have multiple sessions. You can see that we're still at 0 from 14 this again, please bear in mind. Is a demo site? We're working heavily to have the first version of this minimal viable product by the end of January, which we'd love to show you then too.

**Raul Bergen - 22:40**
And really the idea is very simple. You come in here as a person that wants to capture knowledge from someone, be it a retiree, someone that's about to leave, or be it the second case that you have to capture business processes, you can outcome here as an administrator and start a new campaign. And here you can exactly specify what kind of process you'd like to capture. Whether it's the knowledge of a person, like I mentioned before or the knowledge, for example, of such a business process, which right now, we put in as a project or even a next step further if you want to capture the knowledge of various team members and keep them inside of the knowledge pool of the team.

**Raul Bergen - 23:21**
With that once once you choose your field what the system allows you. Again, bear in mind this system is for humans, but it's heavily augmented with artificial intelligence and the way artificial intelligence works, is that the more information you give it? The better the outcome of the artificial intelligence will be so when planning a new campaign here, you can add as much information about the person of whom you want to capture this knowledge. So that the AI can then best assist you in all next processes. So for example, you can add information about who this person is, the role title, their department, their years of experience and the company. You can add information about what expertise you would like to capture, right? What is it that they have been doing this whole time? What do you want to understand skills that you can focus on?

**Raul Bergen - 24:17**
You can upload here also standard skills, frameworks that you have generated with other programs that you might have where you can just upload all of their skills for the AI system to then take into consideration when they're doing their calculations. And very importantly, you as a someone setting up these interviews might not know that person that well, that's how you can also invite collaborators, people that are working closely with that person, which will then get sent a survey to fill out. Hey, what do you know about this person? What is the key process that they are responsible for? Which would not work if they leave or what is missing for you to understand the whole image. So here you can share collaborators, you can send out these surveys. Let me quickly show you how they look like. This is for example, the survey you get as a collaborator for the for Raphael. So your Santa noon, you have your friend Rafael, that is leaving and you get some questions asked which you can quickly answer. You get them via email.

**Raul Bergen - 25:21**
You can answer them and then all the information collected, be it from the collaborators, be it from the interview also gets a questionnaire, which they can fill out with how they assess their knowledge where they think they are important. All of this context together with any documents that you upload, be it reports, bits, powerpoints of the person you're trying to interview, be it anything else. This knowledge is then being used to generate the schedule of these sessions that you're gonna make, right? And the interesting part is the sessions are

**Raul Bergen - 26:05**
Are then agreed with the interview. So this the system will automatically send them invites into their calendar and into the interviewers calendar to then set up a session. You can set how long you want these sessions to be you guys. I can imagine you have your standards for how long these sessions can be. They can be from anything from 15 minutes to 2 hours or more. And these sessions are then actually video calls. They look like this. Let me quickly show you. The sessions are video calls right now. The camera functionality doesn't work. Because obviously, my camera is connected to to this call right now. But the way this works is that this is the view of the interviewer first of all before the call, they get prompted to prepare with all the information that was collected by the collaborators. They get a self assessment that was generated by the AI for the interviewer to then have the best possible knowledge before entering the call. They're like, oh, okay. That's this and this person they have 25 years of experience. These are the topics. That we need to cover. These are insights from the collaborator. Number one, these are insights from the collaborator, number 2 and then the interviewer can go into the session already understanding what needs to happen.

**Raul Bergen - 27:27**
Again, what we're building up as a platform to help this interviewer, make these capture processes as efficient as possible. Then during the call, the interviewer has a page completely powered by AI. That can help suggest questions based on the topic that was determined for that day, right? Because our AI system will generate a schedule, maybe for 30 calls. 2 calls a week for 15 weeks, 30 minutes each and on that schedule. It will also tell you what the topics need to be for that day to best advance on. You might have a timeline. You might have a person that leaves in 6 months you need to capture it all by then. So the AI is constantly keeping the process of how you're doing. It's suggesting you questions based on the live trans transcript. So we are recording everything live. We are taking up all the information live. And we are suggesting questions here on the side. For example, you can see the live skills that you covered. Every time you take something off by. By talking about it automatically gets marked here as hey, this is a skill you just caught up. It's okay. You got green is covered. Orange is mentioned and white is still to discuss. So the idea is really to give the interviewer the best overview.

**Raul Bergen - 28:45**
This is like a dashboard as they're speaking so that they can purely focus one on the experience on giving a real human experience to the person that they are interviewing and to cap focusing then really on the conversation where they can really understand what is being shared and so on at the end of these sessions all of the insights are gathered what is being created then is this kind of knowledge hub where you can kind of track from each person how far you are what insights you captured it automatically generates reports that you can share with your team that you can share with your manager that you can share with more people you can have a person view where you can see the knowledge hub of each person you can have a project view where you can see the knowledge we captured image different project right or you can have again a teams view where you can see the knowledge captured in separate teams and the idea then not the ideal what we're doing right now is all of this knowledge is structured in such a format so that it's most efficient as possible for AI and to be found by your team and used by your team I know we're very tight on time I just wanted to make sure that we're still okay does is there a hard stop right now on your end

**Crystal Lucia Wagner - 30:07**
To run

**Raul Bergen - 30:09**
Okay. But I hope with this, we could give you a bit of an overview of currently what we're building. We're very excited. We're doing this at lightning speed and we're gonna have the first minimum lovable product. We call it by the end of January and we'd love if you guys could have your hands on it and test it out and shape this product with us so that we can shape it exactly for your needs.

**Raul Bergen - 30:33**
Thank you.

**Raul Bergen - 30:35**
I've gotta run to

**Raul Bergen - 30:39**
To all of that had the time to listen for right now. We'll send you more information via email. Whoever has to jump off. Please feel free just to jump off right now. I don't want to

**Denis Sternberg - 30:48**
Your time.

**Mary Pat Zolna - 30:49**
Thanks, yeah. Thank you. Great to meet you. I appreciate the demo. Bye bye.

**Raul Bergen - 30:53**
Cool. So Nick, I suggest we can send you all the information. We can also gladly send you this recording so you can share it with your team and you can understand a bit more what we've been building here on our end. And would love to have you guys have your hands on it and try it out. January will be ready.

**Nick Allen - 31:13**
Let me see. It's I feel like we kinda ran short on time.

**Raul Bergen - 31:17**
Yeah.

**Nick Allen - 31:18**
To really to give it a full justice. So. I'll connect back with the team and see what they're thinking and you know, if we want to set up like a part two, right? Discussion

**Raul Bergen - 31:30**
So badly

**Nick Allen - 31:32**
Yeah. And I'm sure they probably have some questions and stuff.

**Denis Sternberg - 31:36**
So and Nick just to let you know, we are working with a couple of other companies. CNA across the world to to help test this out and build this product to make sure that it's not just it's just gonna be one view. We're looking at it from a few different views to get to really build it to be the best that it can be. And we appreciate your interest in your participation.

**Nick Allen - 32:04**
Yeah. Yeah. No problem. All right. Well, thanks guys. Appreciate it.

**Raul Bergen - 32:09**
Thank you. I'll send you all the information then. Perfect. Nick, thank you so much. Talk to you soon.

**Denis Sternberg - 32:15**
Okay. Bye. Bye.

**Thomas Bergen - 32:17**
Raul, Denis, can you stay in the call? Yeah. Let's

**Thomas Bergen - 32:22**
Let's don't record

**Raul Bergen - 32:25**
No. It's not just the note taker, can we remove the note taker?

**Denis Sternberg - 32:28**
Yeah. I'm gonna try to do that to

**Raul Bergen - 32:31**
People

**Raul Bergen - 32:33**
Um
