# CNA Discovery Call - Insights & Analysis

**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Client:** CNA Insurance
**Call Duration:** ~32 minutes (ran short)
**Status:** Follow-up call needed

---

## Client Profile

### Organization
- **Company:** CNA Insurance
- **Department:** Operations / Organizational Process Excellence
- **Focus Areas:** Underwriting operations, policy servicing, business process design

### Key Stakeholders

| Name | Role | Primary Interest |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Nick Allen** | Operations leader | Retiring employee knowledge capture; business process documentation |
| **Crystal Lucia Wagner** | Process Design Lead | Current state documentation; process redesign; change management |
| **Mary Pat Zolna** | Training, Communication & Change Management Lead | Process documentation for training design; SME knowledge capture; AI acceleration |
| **Vanessa** | Operations (mentioned) | Business process capture |

---

## Two Distinct Use Cases Identified

### Use Case 1: Retiring Employee Knowledge Capture
- **Trigger:** ~10 critical employees leaving (many with 30+ years experience)
- **Domains:** Technology, audit, and other specialized areas
- **Pain:** Short notice retirement announcements (sometimes just 1 month)
- **Need:** Capture tacit knowledge before it walks out the door

### Use Case 2: Business Process Documentation
- **Scope:** Operations-wide process capture and redesign
- **Challenge:** Many processes are undocumented ("just in someone's head")
- **Goal:** Feed documented processes into AI systems for accessibility

---

## Current State & Pain Points

### How They Currently Capture Knowledge

1. **Process demos** - Sit with SME and watch them work
2. **Session recordings** - Record everything, transcribe later
3. **Working sessions** - Create process maps, journey maps, procedure docs
4. **Vendor support** - External vendor does process mapping and identifies automation opportunities
5. **Enterprise AI tool** - Limited to note-taking and decision point capture

### Critical Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Quote |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Inconsistent knowledge** | "If you ask 2 different SMEs, you might get 2 different answers" | Crystal |
| **Small team capacity** | "Small but mighty team" - can't get ahead of documentation backlog | Crystal |
| **Reactive, not proactive** | "Just in time" - only document when project requires it | Crystal |
| **Undocumented business units** | "Don't have current state" for many processes | Crystal |
| **Short retirement notice** | "They tell us they're retiring in a month" | Mary Pat |
| **Limited AI capabilities** | Current tool "pretty limited in what it can give us" | Crystal |

### Relationship & Trust Dynamics
- **Business partner model** - They maintain relationships with underwriting business partners
- **Trust is critical** - "Change can be scary" - they are the trusted intermediary
- **No direct vendor contact** - Vendors don't interact directly with underwriters
- **Implication for product:** The human interviewer role is essential, not optional

### Nice-to-Haves (Inferred)

## Competitive/Alternative Solutions Mentioned

| Solution | Current Use | Limitations |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Enterprise AI tool | Note-taking, decision points | "Pretty limited" |
| External vendor | Process mapping, automation ID | No direct SME contact |
| Manual recording | Session capture | Labor-intensive transcription |

---

## Strategic Insights for Product Development

### Validation of Product Direction
1. **Hybrid approach validated** - Human interviewer + AI assistance is exactly what they want
2. **Two campaign types needed** - Person (retirees) AND Project (business process) modes confirmed
3. **Collaborator input valued** - Survey feature aligns with their need for multiple perspectives
4. **Skill tracking resonates** - Helps address "what have we covered" problem

### Feature Priority Implications

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Person campaign type | HIGH | Primary use case (retiring experts) |
| Project campaign type | HIGH | Secondary use case (business process) |
| Collaborator surveys | HIGH | Addresses conflicting SME input problem |
| Real-time question suggestions | HIGH | Helps small team be more effective |
| Report generation | MEDIUM | Needed for management visibility |
| Training integration | FUTURE | Mary Pat's specific need |

### Potential Differentiators
- **Trust-preserving workflow** - Keeps human interviewer as relationship anchor
- **Reconciliation of conflicting inputs** - Handle "2 different answers" problem
- **Capacity multiplication** - Help small team cover more ground

## Quotes Worth Noting

> "You wouldn't want them just to kind of spit in all their information into an AI because that just doesn't work and it doesn't honor the person's life work if it's 30 plus years." — Raul (reflecting Nick's earlier input)

> "We might get several different variations of the process. And then we have to understand what's the best path." — Crystal

> "They tell us they're retiring in a month or something and we have very little time to capture that." — Mary Pat

> "Our team is small but mighty. But we don't have a lot of capacity to get very, very ahead of documenting current state processes." — Crystal

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Call ran short - incomplete discovery | Schedule follow-up "part two" |
| Multiple stakeholders with different priorities | Ensure product handles both use cases well |
| Change management sensitivity | Emphasize human-in-the-loop throughout |
| MVP timeline pressure | January deadline is tight |
