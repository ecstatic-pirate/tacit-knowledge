# Banorte Product Demo - Insights & Analysis

**Date:** January 14, 2025
**Client:** Banorte (Mexican Bank)
**Call Duration:** ~63 minutes
**Status:** Follow-up demo scheduled in ~2 weeks

---

## Client Profile

### Organization
- **Company:** Banorte - Major Mexican bank
- **Department:** Learning & Talent Development
- **Focus Areas:** Learning strategy, talent management, internal knowledge capture

### Key Stakeholders

| Name | Role | Primary Interest |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Miwa Elena Arambula Hayasaka** | Directora De Aprendizaje (Director of Learning) | Multi-format content creation, internal knowledge capture, AI strategy |
| **Felipe Alejandro Rodriguez Huerta** | Coordinador De Gestión De Talento (Talent Coordinator) | Cost efficiency, practical implementation |

### Additional Stakeholders (Not on Call)
- **Alessandra** - Director (Miwa's supervisor) - has vision across attraction to development
- **Brenda** - Team member to be included in next demo
- **Luis** - Team member to be included in next demo

---

## Two Distinct Use Cases Identified

### Use Case 1: Multi-Format Content Creation
- **Pain:** Creating same content in multiple formats is expensive and time-consuming
- **Quote:** "Prácticamente imposible hacer un mismo contenido en diferentes formatos" (Felipe)
- **Need:** Generate content that adapts to learning preferences efficiently

### Use Case 2: Internal Knowledge Capture
- **Scope:** Capitalizing on knowledge from experienced bankers
- **Challenge:** Generational shift - veteran bankers ("los banqueros de antes") need to transfer knowledge
- **Example done:** "Lecciones aprendidas" (lessons learned) videos from senior credit analysts sharing failed case analyses
- **Status:** Some ad-hoc video capture, but not systematic practice

---

## Current State & Pain Points

### What They've Done So Far
1. **Lessons learned videos** - Senior credit analysts share analysis of failed cases
2. **Ad-hoc knowledge capture** - Not systematic or common practice
3. **Totara LMS** - Existing learning platform (executives don't use it)

### Critical Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact | Quote |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Multi-format cost** | Can't afford to create content in different formats | "Prácticamente imposible" - Felipe |
| **No systematic capture** | Knowledge capture not common practice | "No está práctica común" - Miwa |
| **Executives don't use platforms** | 200 directors won't log into Totara | "Esta audiencia no entra a las plataformas" - Miwa |
| **Generational knowledge transfer** | Veteran bankers retiring without transferring knowledge | "Los banqueros de antes" - Miwa |
| **Time and budget constraints** | Adding AI increases complexity and cost | Felipe |

### Forward-Looking Concern (Miwa's Insight)

Miwa raised a sophisticated concern about AI adoption risks:

> "Cuando llega la IA, se brinca todo el proceso porque solo conoce la última parte y si algo se fractura en la tecnología, nadie sabe cómo se construye porque nadie vivió en ese momento... Esta parte de la gente que va entrando y que pues ya no recorre el camino completo porque pues simplemente la respuesta está."

**Translation:** When AI arrives, it skips the whole process because it only knows the last part. If technology breaks, no one knows how it was built because no one lived through that moment. New people don't travel the complete path because the answer is just there.

**Implication:** Knowledge capture becomes even more valuable as AI adoption increases - organizations need to preserve the "how" not just the "what."

---

## Key Requirements Surfaced

### Must-Haves (Explicit)
1. **Minimal clicks** - Executives won't tolerate complex login flows
2. **Email-based delivery** - Push content to users who won't enter platforms
3. **Verification mechanisms** - Data quality matters for AI integration
4. **Copilot/AI integration** - Knowledge must feed into Microsoft Copilot

### Should-Haves (Implied)
1. **Accelerated capture** - Not just for retiring people, but for critical positions
2. **Cost efficiency** - Help small team scale without adding headcount
3. **Multi-format output** - Once captured, generate various content formats

### Nice-to-Haves (Requested)
1. **Facial expression analysis** - Gabriel asked about non-verbal communication capture
2. **Tone analysis** - Currently supported; expressions are not

## Product Demo Feedback

### Features Shown
- Campaign creation (Expert vs Project types)
- Crowdsourced scoping (collaborator surveys)
- Document upload for context
- AI-generated session plans
- Real-time interview dashboard with dynamic questions
- Skills tracking (covered/mentioned/to discuss)
- Two capture modes: AI-only vs Human-assisted
- Verification workflows (AI contradiction analysis + human review)
- Knowledge hub with team/project organization
- MCP connector and Microsoft Graph integration

### Reception
- **Very positive:** "Te quedaste corto Juan Carlos" (You undersold it) - Felipe
- **Engaged questions:** Miwa asked sophisticated questions about verification, acceleration, integration
- **Follow-up scheduled:** Demo with extended team in ~2 weeks

### Questions Asked by Client

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Can sessions be accelerated for critical (non-retiring) roles? | Yes, Colombia case does ongoing capture | Validates non-retirement use case |
| How is information verified? | AI contradiction analysis + human manager review | Verification is important for Copilot integration |
| How does it connect to Copilot? | MCP connector, Microsoft Graph integration | Integration path is clear |
| Can it analyze facial expressions? | Not yet, only tone | Feature request for roadmap |

## Pilot Cases Mentioned (Reference for Banorte)

### Chicago Pilot
- **Scenario:** 10 people retiring in 7 months
- **Approach:** Human-to-human interviews
- **Unique aspect:** New hires interview departing experts
- **Rationale:** "Wouldn't be right to use only AI for 30-year veterans"
- **Benefit:** Knowledge transfer happens during interviews, not just to system

### Colombia Pilot
- **Scenario:** 35,000 employees, critical process capture
- **Approach:** AI-only interviews, 15 min/week
- **Rationale:** "If we capture 20%, it's 1000x better than 0%"
- **Use case:** Ongoing process capture, not retirement-driven

### Brazil Pilot
- **Scenario:** Consulting company
- **Details:** Not elaborated in this call

## Strategic Insights for Product Development

### Validation of Product Direction
1. **Hybrid approach valued** - Chicago case resonated (human interviewers for veterans)
2. **Non-retirement use case confirmed** - Miwa specifically asked about critical positions
3. **AI integration is key** - Copilot/Microsoft Graph integration is expected
4. **Verification matters** - Client immediately asked about data quality

### Feature Priority Implications

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| MCP/Microsoft Graph connector | HIGH | Required for Copilot integration |
| Verification workflows | HIGH | Data quality for AI systems |
| Accelerated capture mode | HIGH | Critical positions, not just retiring |
| Human-assisted interviews | HIGH | Chicago case resonated |
| AI-only interviews | MEDIUM | Colombia case for scale |
| Non-verbal analysis | FUTURE | Gabriel's feature request |
| Multi-format output generation | FUTURE | Miwa's content creation pain point |

### Potential Differentiators for Banorte
- **Copilot integration** - Knowledge feeds directly into their AI strategy
- **Verification layer** - Ensures quality before data enters AI systems
- **Flexibility** - Both AI-only and human-assisted modes available
- **Cost efficiency** - Addresses their multi-format content creation challenge
